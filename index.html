    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Kaan. I am a senior Mechanical Engineering student at Katip Çelebi University. I have a passion for scientific research and engineering, particularly in the field of aerospace technologies. I aim to become a researcher and problem-solver who understands both science and its practical applications.
    </p>

    <p>
      During my academic journey, I have worked on CFD simulations of a hydrodynamic journal bearing and on the film cooling of turbine blades. I am currently working remotely with CORET (Combustion Research Team) from Tarsus University, and I will also be a voluntary research internship at ODTÜ-GÜNAM (Center for Solar Energy Research and Applications) beginning 25 agust. If you want to learn more about my work, you can check the "Projects" section. Also here is my <span class="cv-link" onclick="window.open('Kaan Cebir.pdf', '_blank')">CV</span>.
    </p>

    <p>
      My goal is to be someone who understands physics, mathematics, and the fundamentals of engineering—someone who views the world like a scientist. I also enjoy doing calisthenics and reading. I might post a few of my writings as well.
